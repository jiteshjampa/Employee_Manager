## ‚ö†Ô∏è How to Fix "Connection Failed" Error in MySQL

If you're getting a `java.sql.SQLException: Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost'` error, follow these steps:

1. **Check MySQL User Permissions**:
   - Login to MySQL:
     ```bash
     mysql -u root -p
     ```
   - Grant all privileges to the user (replace `yourpassword` with your MySQL password):
     ```sql
     GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpassword';
     FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
     ```

2. **Verify the Database Connection**:
   - Make sure MySQL is running and the port is correct. If using Docker, ensure MySQL container is running and accessible.

3. **Check for Database URL Configuration**:
   - Ensure your `application.properties` file has the correct database URL, username, and password.

4. **Restart the Application**:
   - After making the above changes, restart the Spring Boot application to reflect the new database configurations.

+-----------------+        +------------------+        +----------------+
|   Department   |        |     Employee     |        |     Task       |
+-----------------+        +------------------+        +----------------+
| - id: Long      | 1   *  | - id: Long       | 1   *  | - id: Long     |
| - name: String  |<------>| - name: String   |<------>| - description: |
|                 |        | - role: String   |        |   String       |
|                 |        | - department:    |        | - employee:    |
|                 |        |   Department     |        |   Employee     |
|                 |        | - tasks: List<Task>|        +----------------+
